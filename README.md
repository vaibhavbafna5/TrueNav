# TrueNav
Android app that shows the true cost of a journey based on financial expenses, environmental impact, and time.

## The Problem

I was inspired to build this app after reading [this article](https://medium.com/sidewalk-talk/driving-costs-are-hidden-revealing-them-could-help-reduce-traffic-448b416714e2) published by Sidewalk Labs. The article argued that current navigation apps are misleading as they only show users a portion of information that's relevant to the decision they make. As Willa Ng, the Mobility Lead at Sidewalk Labs and author of the article writes:

> "At the moment, navigation apps tend to keep driving costs largely hidden. Most apps rank routes and modes based on travel time: the fastest option wins. The implicit assumption here is that the monetary costs among options balance out. But if you did see all the monetary costs of a trip choice before you left the house — in addition to the time costs — you might make a different travel decision."

Clearly a problem exists, but so does a solution. 

## The Solution


Before I could start typing away, it was important to do research and understand the nuances of the problem I was dealing with. After reading the existing literature, I decided that version 1 of the app would look at popular modes of transport and give the user an analysis of their journey based on a few key metrics. 

Modes of transport:
* Walking
* Transit
* Driving

Metrics for determining "true cost": 
* Time/Distance
* Financial Cost
* Environmental Impact 

Here it is in action:
