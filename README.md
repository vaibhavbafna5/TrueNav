# TrueNav
Android app that shows the true cost of a journey based on financial expenses, environmental impact, and time.

## Why?

I was inspired to build this app after reading this article written by Sidewalk Labs (https://tinyurl.com/yclco9z7). The article argued that current navigation apps are misleading as they only show users a chunk of information that's relevant to the decision they make. As Willa Ng, the Mobility Lead at Sidewalk Labs and author of the article writes:

> "At the moment, navigation apps tend to keep driving costs largely hidden. Most apps rank routes and modes based on travel time: the fastest option wins. The implicit assumption here is that the monetary costs among options balance out. But if you did see all the monetary costs of a trip choice before you left the house — in addition to the time costs — you might make a different travel decision."
